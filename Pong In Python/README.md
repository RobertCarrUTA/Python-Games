# Pong in Python

## About
While making Pong with the turtle library for Python, I encountered an issue where both paddles failed to move simultaneously. Pygame seemed a good fit, so I used it. In addition, I added an opponent player to the game. There is still work to be done on the opponent, but it is passable for now. I may add difficulties and high scores later on.

## Compile Instructions
* Enter **python pong.py** into the terminal where the file is located

## Controls
*Controls can be changed, just CTRL + F (or something similar) **if keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:***


Unedited controls are:
* Player (right side paddle)
  * Up: Up Arrow
  * Down: Down Arrow
